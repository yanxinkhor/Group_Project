The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (Sendai Framework) was the first major  agreement of the post-2015 development agenda 
and provides Member States with concrete actions to protect development gains from the risk of disaster.

Endorsed by the UN General Assembly following the 2015 Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR), the Sendai Framework
advocates for:

- The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental 
assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries.

- It recognizes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared with other stakeholders including local 
government, the private sector and other stakeholders.
