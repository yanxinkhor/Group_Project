Disaster Mitigation is the cornerstone of emergency management. It’s the ongoing effort to lessen the impact disasters have on people and property. 
Mitigation involves keeping homes away from floodplains, engineering bridges to withstand earthquakes, creating and enforcing effective building 
codes to protect property from hurricanes, and more.

Mitigation is defined as “sustained action that reduces or eliminates long-term risk to people and property from natural hazards and their effects.” 
It describes the ongoing effort at the federal, state, local and individual levels to lessen the impact of disasters upon our families, homes, communities 
and economy.
